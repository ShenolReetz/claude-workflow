# Claude Workflow Automation System

An automated content creation pipeline that generates YouTube-style "Top 5" product videos with affiliate monetization using AI and web scraping.

## üé• What It Does

This system automatically:
1. Reads topic ideas from Airtable (e.g., "Top 5 Gaming Laptops 2025")
2. Generates SEO-optimized content using Claude AI
3. Creates product countdown scripts
4. Fetches Amazon affiliate links
5. Produces videos using JSON2Video API
6. Uploads to Google Drive with organized folder structure
7. Updates Airtable with video URLs

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Built using MCP (Model Context Protocol) microservices:
- **Content Generation MCP** - SEO keywords, titles, descriptions
- **Amazon Affiliate MCP** - Product links and monetization
- **JSON2Video MCP** - Video creation and rendering

## üÜï Text Generation Control MCP

The latest addition to the system is the **Text Generation Control MCP**, which ensures all generated content meets strict timing requirements for text-to-speech conversion.

### Features:
- **9-Second Timing Validation**: Each product description is validated to ensure it can be read in exactly 9 seconds
- **Automatic Regeneration**: Products that don't meet timing requirements are automatically regenerated
- **Keyword Enforcement**: Ensures SEO keywords are properly integrated into product descriptions
- **Category Validation**: Verifies products match their assigned categories

### Implementation Files:
- `mcp_servers/text_generation_control_server.py` - Quality control server
- `src/mcp/text_generation_control_agent_mcp_v2.py` - Control agent with regeneration loop

### Workflow Integration:
The Text Control MCP runs after countdown script generation to ensure all products meet quality standards before proceeding to video creation.
