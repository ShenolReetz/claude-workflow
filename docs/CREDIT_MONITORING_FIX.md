# Credit Monitoring System - Fix Summary

## 🔧 Issue Resolved

The credit monitoring system was incorrectly showing **0 credits** for JSON2Video and ScrapingDog APIs, when in reality both services had **sufficient credits** available.

## 🐛 Root Cause

The problem was in the API response parsing logic in `mcp_servers/credit_monitor_server.py`:

### 1. JSON2Video API Issue
- **Expected**: `{"credits": 123}` 
- **Actual**: `{"remaining_quota": {"time": 11854}}`
- **Fix**: Updated parser to read `remaining_quota.time` (seconds) and convert to estimated videos

### 2. ScrapingDog API Issue  
- **Expected**: `{"requests_remaining": 123}`
- **Actual**: `{"requestLimit": 201000, "requestUsed": 2130}`
- **Fix**: Updated parser to calculate `requestLimit - requestUsed`

## ✅ Current Status (Fixed)

### API Credits Available:
- **JSON2Video**: €39.40 (~197 videos, 11,854 seconds) ✅
- **ScrapingDog**: €198.87 (198,870 requests remaining) ✅  
- **ElevenLabs**: €32.32 (179,537 characters) ✅
- **Airtable**: Free tier (unlimited) ✅

### Total Value: €270.59 available across all services

## 🔍 Technical Changes Made

### JSON2Video Credit Check Fixed:
```python
# Before (incorrect):
credits_remaining = data.get('credits', 0)

# After (correct):
remaining_quota = data.get('remaining_quota', {})
time_seconds = remaining_quota.get('time', 0)
video_count = time_seconds // 60
```

### ScrapingDog Credit Check Fixed:
```python
# Before (incorrect):
requests_remaining = data.get('requests_remaining', 0)

# After (correct):
request_limit = data.get('requestLimit', 0)
request_used = data.get('requestUsed', 0)
requests_remaining = request_limit - request_used
```

## 📊 Test Results

### Before Fix:
```
🚨 JSON2Video: €0.00 - Credits: 0 remaining
🚨 ScrapingDog: €0.00 - Requests: 0 remaining
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ JSON2Video: €39.40 - Time: 11,854s (~197 videos)
✅ ScrapingDog: €198.87 - Requests: 198,870 remaining (2,130/201,000 used)
```

## 🎯 Impact on Workflow

### Workflow Status: **READY FOR PRODUCTION** ✅

With the credit monitoring fix, the workflow can now:
- ✅ Generate ~197 videos with JSON2Video
- ✅ Make 198,870 Amazon product searches with ScrapingDog
- ✅ Generate 179,537 characters of voice with ElevenLabs
- ✅ Run for months without needing credit top-ups

### Cost Analysis:
- **Per Video**: ~€1.10 (all services combined)
- **Monthly**: ~€33 for 30 videos
- **Current Credits**: Can produce 197 videos (~6.5 months of content)

## 🔄 Future Monitoring

The credit monitoring system now:
- ✅ Accurately reports all API credits
- ✅ Sends email alerts when credits drop below €10
- ✅ Provides detailed usage statistics
- ✅ Includes direct top-up links for each service

## 📧 Email Alerts
