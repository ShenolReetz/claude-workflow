## üß† Reusable Prompt for 9:16 E-Commerce Product Photo Generation

> **"A high-resolution, ultra-realistic 9:16 vertical product photo of a \[PRODUCT\_NAME], floating slightly above the ground with a soft natural shadow underneath. The product is rendered in sharp detail with accurate lighting reflections and visible textures. The background features a vibrant, colorful gradient with a bokeh or abstract lighting effect to draw attention without distracting from the product. The product should be centered and isolated, with dramatic lighting, realistic shadows, and soft depth-of-field blur in the background. Ensure a clean, commercial-grade look suitable for e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Shopify, and mobile apps. Leave some negative space at the top and bottom for overlaying text or logos."**
