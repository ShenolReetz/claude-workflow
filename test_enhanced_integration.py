🎯 ENHANCED INTEGRATION BENEFITS:

🛡️ CRITICAL FAILURE PROTECTION:
   ✅ Photos/Audio MUST be accurate or video STOPS
   ✅ No more inaccurate product videos
   ✅ Manual notification when critical failures occur
   
🔄 SMART RETRY SYSTEM:
   ✅ 3 retry attempts per component with different strategies
   ✅ Never gets stuck in infinite loops
   ✅ Intelligent fallbacks for recoverable failures
   
🎭 MCP PLAYWRIGHT INTEGRATION:
   ✅ ScrapingDog → Playwright MCP → Direct → Manual
   ✅ Cost-efficient alternative to paid APIs
   ✅ Real browser automation for better reliability
   ✅ Screenshots for debugging scraping issues
   
📊 COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING:
   ✅ 31 total prerequisites (17 status + 14 URLs)
   ✅ Real-time progress tracking
   ✅ Enhanced status reporting
   ✅ VideoProductionRDY security gates
   
⚡ WORKFLOW RESILIENCE:
   ✅ Never blocks entire workflow unnecessarily
   ✅ Continues workflow to populate more prerequisites
   ✅ Clean stops only for truly critical failures
   ✅ Automatic retry for recoverable issues
   
🎬 PRODUCTION READY:
   ✅ Integrated into main workflow_runner.py
   ✅ Maintains all existing functionality
   ✅ Adds safety without breaking changes
   ✅ Ready for 4,188 title processing
