# 📋 TODO - Production Workflow V2

## 🚨 CRITICAL - GO LIVE TONIGHT (August 14, 2025)

### 🎯 PHASE 1: FIX REMAINING ERRORS
- [ ] **Fix Airtable Update Error (422)**
  - [ ] Debug why "Invalid request: parameter validation failed" occurs
  - [ ] Check field data types being sent to Airtable
  - [ ] Ensure all field values are properly formatted
  - [ ] Test with mcp__airtable__update_records tool directly

- [ ] **Fix WordPress Publishing Error (400)**

### 🚀 PHASE 2: FULL WORKFLOW VALIDATION

#### 🖥️ IMPORTANT: Terminal Output Requirements
- [ ] **ALWAYS run Production workflow with LIVE terminal output**
  - [ ] NO Bash timeout or minimum 30-minute timeout (1800000ms)
  - [ ] Use `run_in_background: true` for long-running workflows
  - [ ] Monitor real-time progress without interruptions
  - [ ] Capture all logs for debugging

**Run Command Examples:**
```bash
# Direct run with live output (preferred)
python3 run_ultra_optimized.py

# With Claude Code - use 30min timeout
# Bash timeout: 1800000 (30 minutes)
# Or use run_in_background: true
```

- [ ] **Run Complete End-to-End Test**
  - [ ] Start fresh with new pending title
  - [ ] Monitor all 14 workflow steps WITH LIVE OUTPUT
  - [ ] Verify Remotion renders without JSON2Video

  - [ ] NO TIMEOUTS during execution

- [ ] **Performance Validation**
  - [ ] Total time under 5 minutes ✅ (Currently 4m 35s)

# Test WordPress connection
python3 -c "from src.mcp.production_wordpress_mcp_v2 import *; wp = ProductionWordPressMCP(config); wp.test_connection()"
