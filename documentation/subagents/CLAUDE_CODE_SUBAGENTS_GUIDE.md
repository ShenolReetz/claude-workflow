## 🚀 **Implementation Guide**

### **Step 1: Create Agent Structure**
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /home/claude-workflow

# Create agent directories
mkdir -p .claude/agents/{orchestrator,airtable_manager,content_generation,amazon_research,video_creator,social_media_publisher,performance_monitor,flow_monitor}

# Copy configurations to respective directories
# (Save each agent configuration as CLAUDE.md in its directory)
```

### **Step 2: Install Required MCP Tools**
```bash
# Essential Tools (Required)
claude mcp add airtable -e AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your-token -- npx -y @domdomegg/airtable-mcp-server
claude mcp add sequential-thinking npx -- -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking

# High-Value Tools (Recommended)  
claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
claude mcp add playwright npx -- @playwright/mcp@latest
```

### **Step 3: Test Individual Agents**
```bash
# Test Airtable connection
claude-code chat --agent airtable_manager --message "Fetch 1 pending topic for testing"

# Test content generation
claude-code chat --agent content_generation --message "Generate content for: Best Gaming Laptops 2025"

# Test orchestrator coordination  
claude-code chat --agent orchestrator --message "Run morning batch with 1 topic for testing"
```

### **Step 4: Replace Current Workflow**
1. **Update cron jobs** to trigger orchestrator instead of workflow_runner.py
2. **Maintain Python services** as fallback during transition
3. **Monitor performance** and compare success rates
4. **Gradually increase** batch sizes as agents prove reliable
