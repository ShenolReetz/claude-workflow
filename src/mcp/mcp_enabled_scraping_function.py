    üé≠ PLAYWRIGHT MCP BENEFITS vs ScrapingDog:
    
    ‚úÖ COST EFFICIENCY:
    - No per-request API costs (ScrapingDog charges per request)
    - Unlimited scraping within resource limits
    - No monthly subscription fees
    
    ‚úÖ RELIABILITY:
    - Direct browser automation (real Chrome browser)
    - JavaScript rendering (handles dynamic content)
    - Screenshots for debugging
    - Less likely to be blocked (real browser behavior)
    
    ‚úÖ CONTROL:
    - Custom extraction logic
    - Ability to interact with page elements
    - Wait for specific elements to load
    - Handle complex user interactions
    
    ‚úÖ INTEGRATION:
    - Built into our MCP workflow
    - No external API dependencies
    - Real-time debugging capabilities
    - Easy to modify extraction logic
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Requires browser installation (one-time setup)
    - Slightly slower than API calls
    - Uses more resources (browser instance)
    - Need to handle browser management
    
    üéØ RECOMMENDATION:
    Use Playwright MCP as primary alternative to ScrapingDog
