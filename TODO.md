# TODO List - Video Generation Issues for Tomorrow

## üöÄ CURRENT STATUS (END OF DAY - August 2, 2025)

**Status:** PAUSED - Ready for Tomorrow's Debugging Session  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Timeline:** Continue August 3, 2025

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 COMPLETED: Project Cleanup & Architecture
1. **Complete project cleanup** - Removed 100+ outdated files ‚úÖ
2. **Expert agents system removed** - Deleted src/expert_agents/ directory ‚úÖ
3. **Clean workflow runner** - Based on Test structure with real APIs ‚úÖ
4. **Essential files only** - Streamlined to production-ready structure ‚úÖ
5. **Import fixes** - All dependencies working correctly ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Phase 2A COMPLETED: Dynamic Schema Integration
1. **Production_json2video_schema.json Dynamic Conversion** ‚úÖ
   - Converted all hardcoded values to `{{placeholder}}` syntax
   - Added placeholders for titles, images, audio, ratings, reviews, prices
   - Template system ready for dynamic data injection

2. **Enhanced Production JSON2Video Server** ‚úÖ
   - Added `_replace_placeholders_with_airtable_data()` method
   - Implemented string replacement for all placeholders
   - Added proper data type conversion (numeric values)
   - Winner styling (üèÜ) for Product #1
   - Google Drive audio integration

3. **Workflow Improvements** ‚úÖ
   - Enhanced product data processing
   - Fixed workflow order (save data before video creation)
   - Added comprehensive debugging and logging

## ‚ùå Phase 2B: OUTSTANDING ISSUES (FOR TOMORROW)

### **PRIMARY BLOCKER: Video Generation Failing**

**Problem**: Video creation fails with "No product titles found for video creation"  
**Root Cause**: Product titles not being saved to Airtable during workflow execution  
**Impact**: Complete video generation pipeline blocked  

**Technical Details:**
- ‚úÖ Amazon products scrape successfully (5 products found)
- ‚úÖ Product data mapped to `airtable_data` structure  
- ‚ùå `_save_countdown_to_airtable` method not saving ProductNo1-5Title fields
- ‚ùå Video creation can't find product titles in Airtable
- ‚ùå JSON2Video generation completely blocked

**Test Record**: `rec1cucUfKlPKQqQW` (Action Cameras)
- Title: "üî• 5 INSANE Action Cameras You Need in 2025! (Shocking Price) üìπ"
- Status: Products scraped, titles generated, but not saved to Airtable

## üéØ TOMORROW'S ACTION PLAN (August 3, 2025)

### **Priority 1: Debug Product Title Saving (HIGH)**
- [ ] **Debug countdown script data structure**
  - Verify `generate_countdown_script_with_products` returns correct format
  - Check if `script_data['products']` contains title/description fields
  - Add detailed logging to see exact data structure

- [ ] **Fix Airtable save operation**
  - Debug `_save_countdown_to_airtable` method step-by-step
  - Verify ProductNo1-5Title fields are being written
  - Test Airtable API calls manually if needed
  - Confirm field names match Airtable schema exactly

- [ ] **Validate data flow end-to-end**
  - Amazon scraping ‚Üí Product mapping ‚Üí Script generation ‚Üí Airtable save
  - Ensure no data loss between steps
  - Verify all required fields reach Airtable before video creation

### **Priority 2: Test Video Generation (HIGH)**
- [ ] **Once product titles are saved to Airtable:**
  - Test video creation with dynamic schema system
  - Verify all `{{placeholders}}` are replaced with real data
  - Confirm JSON2Video API receives properly formatted schema
  - Validate video generation completes successfully

- [ ] **End-to-end workflow validation:**
  - Run complete workflow from title selection to video generation
  - Verify all components work: images, audio, ratings, reviews, prices
  - Test video output quality and content accuracy

### **Priority 3: System Optimization (MEDIUM)**
- [ ] **Fix Google Drive token issues**
  - Resolve image generation failures
  - Update expired credentials
  - Test image upload and retrieval

- [ ] **Performance validation**
  - Monitor API usage and costs
  - Optimize workflow execution time
  - Test multiple title processing

## üìä CURRENT TECHNICAL STATUS

### **‚úÖ WORKING COMPONENTS:**
- Airtable integration (read/write operations)
- Amazon product validation and scraping
- Content generation and optimization
- Multi-platform content generation
